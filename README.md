## Introduction
This project was a fun way for me to gain experience with working with API's and to learn to manage API's with Javascript. Additionally, I always wanted to create a project where I could share some of my favorite places in Los Angeles. The project is straightforward in that it currently only has simple functionality. The project manually sets markers to 10 of my favorite places around LA and if you hover over the markers with the mouse cursor then the Wikipedia API will look up that location and display information about that location from wikipedia. In the future I plan to create an alternative version where the users location is asked and then the Google Maps API will set markers based on the most popular places around the users location.
